# Teamworks Help Center Redesign - December 2023

## Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Teamworks Help Center, which has undergone a significant redesign in December 2023. Our customer education team has diligently worked over the past five months to restructure and redesign the Help Center, making it more efficient, user-friendly, and tailored to our expanding suite of products.

## What's New?
- **Individual Help Centers**: Each product now has its own dedicated help center site with a unique URL on Zendesk.
- **Enhanced Navigation**: Users can easily navigate between different product help centers via a dropdown in the header bar.
- **Central Landing Page**: A central landing page allows users to select which product's help center they wish to view, accessible from the Teamworks main website under the 'Support' link.
- **Visually Appealing Design**: An upgraded design enhances the visual appeal and improves navigation for our users.

## Accessing the Help Centers
- **Direct Access via New URLs**: Links to the new individual help centers for each product are provided below.
- **Redirection from Old Links**: Saved links to the previous help center will redirect users to the new sites, with a prompt recommending bookmark updates.
- **Troubleshooting**: In case of any access issues or redirects not working as intended, please contact our customer education team.

## Links to Individual Help Centers
*Here, list the URLs to the individual help centers for each product.*

## Why the Change?
As our product range expanded, we needed a more efficient way to house and organize content within the help center. Transitioning to individual help centers for each product on Zendesk enables us to better manage and present product-specific content, resources, and support.

## Customer Impact
We strive to make this transition seamless for our users:
- Minimal impact on accessing the help centers.
- Redirections ensure continuity and ease of access.
- Users are encouraged to update their bookmarks to the new URLs.
